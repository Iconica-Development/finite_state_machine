/// # Finite State Machine
/// A Dart package for creating and managing finite state machines (FSM).
/// This library provides a robust framework for defining states, transitions,
/// and actions within a state machine, enabling developers to model complex
/// workflows and behaviors in a structured manner.
///
/// ## Features
/// - Define states and transitions with ease.
/// - Support for actions that trigger state changes.
/// - Conditional transitions based on predicates.
/// - Listener management for state changes and transitions.
/// - Payload support for passing data during transitions.
///
/// ## Getting Started
/// To use this package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
/// ```yaml
/// dependencies:
///   finite_state_machine: ^0.1.0
/// ```
/// Then, import the package in your Dart code:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:finite_state_machine/finite_state_machine.dart';
/// ```
/// For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the documentation
/// and example files included in the package.
